# Project 1: Neural Network based algorithm to solve missile navigation problem. R&D Reinforcement learning project.
* Created a tool based on Q-learning algorithm, that trains neural network to solve air-to-air missile navigation problem.
* Sucsessfully presented and proved efficiancy of neural networks in this type of tasks
* Used advanced teqniques such as Dueling Q-learning [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581) and Double Q-learning (Neurips)https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2010/file/091d584fced301b442654dd8c23b3fc9-Paper.pdf]
* Used Pytorch as Neural Network framework, AWS EC2 for cloud computation, Tensorboard to monitor neural network train progression
* Used OpenAI Gym framework to build (custom simulation environment)[https://github.com/Yegres5/missile-env]
* Used YAPPI profiler to optimize computations of custom environment
